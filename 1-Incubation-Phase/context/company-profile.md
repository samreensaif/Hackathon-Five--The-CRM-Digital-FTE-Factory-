## Current Support Landscape

### Growth Challenge
- **January 2025:** 500 paying customers, 3 support agents → manageable load
- **February 2026 (now):** 2,000+ paying customers, 5 support agents → overwhelmed
- **Ticket volume:** ~120 tickets/day (up from ~30/day a year ago)
- **Average first response time:** 4.2 hours (target: < 1 hour)
- **Average resolution time:** 18 hours (target: < 4 hours)
- **Customer satisfaction (CSAT):** 3.6/5.0 (down from 4.4/5.0)
- **First-contact resolution rate:** 52% (target: > 80%)

### Ticket Distribution by Channel
| Channel | % of Volume | Avg Response Time |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Email (Gmail) | 50% | 5.1 hours |
| WhatsApp | 30% | 2.3 hours |
| Web Form | 20% | 6.8 hours |

### Ticket Distribution by Category
| Category | % of Volume | Complexity |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| How-to / Feature Questions | 35% | Low — ideal for AI |
| Technical Issues & Bugs | 25% | Medium — AI can handle common ones |
| Account & Billing | 20% | Medium-High — some need human review |
| Feature Requests & Feedback | 12% | Low — log and acknowledge |
| Complaints & Escalations | 8% | High — often needs human touch |

### Key Pain Points
1. **Response time degradation** — Customers on Free and Pro plans wait 4+ hours for first response
2. **Repetitive questions** — 40% of tickets are answered by the same 20 knowledge base articles
3. **Off-hours coverage** — No support between 10 PM–7 AM PST; international customers in EU/APAC left waiting
4. **Inconsistent quality** — Different agents give different answers to the same question
5. **Agent burnout** — Support agents spending 60% of time on repetitive low-complexity tickets

## Support Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Speed** — Acknowledge every customer within minutes, not hours
2. **Accuracy** — Give the right answer the first time; never guess
3. **Empathy** — Understand the customer's situation before jumping to solutions
4. **Empowerment** — Help customers learn, not just fix their immediate problem
5. **Transparency** — Be honest about what we can and can't do; never overpromise

### Support SLAs by Plan

| Plan | First Response | Resolution Target | Support Hours |
|------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Free | < 24 hours | Best effort | Business hours (9 AM–6 PM PST) |
| Pro | < 4 hours | < 24 hours | Extended hours (7 AM–10 PM PST) |
| Enterprise | < 1 hour | < 8 hours | 24/7 with dedicated account manager |

| Customer Success Lead | Marcus Rivera | Day-to-day support operations, agent coaching |

## Digital FTE Goal

- Handles **80% of Tier 1 tickets** autonomously (how-to, common troubleshooting, feature requests)
- Reduces **average first response time to < 1 minute** across all channels
- Maintains a **CSAT of 4.2+ out of 5.0**
- Frees human agents to focus on **complex technical issues and high-value account management**
- Provides **24/7 coverage** across Gmail, WhatsApp, and Web Form channels
- Escalates appropriately with **full context handoff** to human agents
