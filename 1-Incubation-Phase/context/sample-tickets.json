What's the request limit per minute/hour?\n2. Is there a separate limit for read vs. write operations?\n3. Are webhook deliveries counted against the rate limit?\n4. Is there a way to check my current usage via an API endpoint?\n\nWe're planning to sync task data every 5 minutes with our internal tools and I want to make sure we won't hit any limits.\n\nThanks for clarifying,\nAlex Rivera",

LOGIN ISSUES: For the past three days, I've been intermittently unable to log in. I get a 'Session expired' error even though I just entered my credentials. It usually works after 3-4 attempts but it's very annoying.\n\n2. SYNC PROBLEMS: When I do manage to log in, I'm noticing that tasks I edited on Monday are reverting to their previous state. For example, I updated the description and due date on task TF-9012, but when I checked today, it had the old description and the due date was wrong.\n\n3. MISSING TASKS: Most concerning, there are approximately 8-10 tasks that seem to have completely vanished from our 'Q1 Product Launch' project. These tasks definitely existed last week - I have screenshots showing them in the board view. They're not in the trash either.\n\nI'm starting to worry about data integrity.
